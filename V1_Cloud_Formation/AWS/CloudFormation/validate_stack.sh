# This is a small utility scrip that tests the validate of your CloudFormation
# JSON files. It requires the aws cli, which you probably can install using your
# computer's package manager (apt, yum, brew, ...)
#
# You also need to have configured your AWS credentals, currently they go in the
# file $HOME/.aws/credentials
#
# An example config file looks like this:
#
# [default]
# aws_access_key_id = XXX
# aws_secret_access_key = YYY
